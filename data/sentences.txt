BOOM
This is it
Either which way
Fantastical
What ever takes your fancy
I don't know how those 5 girls got there!
At the end of the day
What I mean is...
Do you understand that?
Smoking on gas
The glass is drying up
Keep hold of your receipts
Moving forward
Munge
Synergise
Basically
What I'm trying to say is...
I'm trying to help
Bottom line is...
Fair play
How's it going?
Put a positive spin on that
I'm never late!
I've only been late once
That's kind of my plan
There was traffic on the A1
This is corporate bullying
I feel bullied
We need to think outside the box
Lets look at the bigger picture
We have to release on that date
We will have to do the meeting tommorow
<insert a> black and white logical fallacy
Shocking
Does that make sense
Do me a favour...
I was in at 8:35am
At that point I can fuck away
I was outside having a smoke
We're getting another developer
Cooking on gas
Phalcon is the fastest framework EVER
Phalcon is the best framework EVER
Stop calling it seagull
To be Honest
We're blinding them with science
I'll leave that with you
What are you working on at the minute?
D'ya know what?
It's fine.
We're all on the same team
We're very agile
Is it in redmine
We'll have that in the [first, second, third] quarter of next year
I hear what you're saying
You going to the machine?
I close all the sales
...and all that Jazz
Mark, can you put the bins out
Oh my days
Obviously.
Plenty a lot.
Gosh
We can take that offline later
It's Fine.
